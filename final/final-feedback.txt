PART 1:
Nice work.  Another option would have been to use Pandas read_html()

PART 2:
Good work.

PART 3:
Nice

PART 4:
Great, but a more efficient way to do this would be using the data frames more natively rather than looping through all of the locations one at a time.  Data frames are built to work all together w/o looping through every row.  -1

PART 5:
Nice work.

PART 6:
Thanks!  Have a great summer.
